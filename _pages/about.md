I am currently pursuing a Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering at UC Riverside, in [Dr. Fabio Pasqualetti](http://www.fabiopas.it/)â€™s lab. Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. is in Robotics and Automation Engineering and a B.Sc. is in Computer Engineering, both from the University of Pisa, Italy.  I have a two years experience in the space science and research field, having collaborated as a student with the European Space Agency. From December 2017 to June 2018 I was Visiting Scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Dr. Magnus Egerstedt](https://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/) and [Prof.ssa Lucia Pallottino](http://www.centropiaggio.unipi.it/~pallottino), working on barrier certificates for safety of swarms of mixed human/autonomous networks of vehicles. In 2019 I was Robotics Engineer Intern at Amazon Advanced Technologies Europe.
