I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, in Dr. [Fabio Pasqualetti](http://www.fabiopas.it/)’s lab. I work on control theory, with a focus on optimal data-driven controls and network controls. I hold a M.Sc. in Robotics and Automation Engineering (2018) and a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, both from the from the University of Pisa. I was Visiting Scholar at Georgia Tech in 2018 with Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Egerstedt). 

I interned at Amazon Robotics in 2018 and I took part in two projects sponsored by the European Space Agency.

**NEWS**
- [**Dec '22**] CDC in Cancun was a blast. If you missed them, I shared the [videos](https://youtu.be/4UpaSSjazic) for [both](https://youtu.be/8isbG4b-Cgs) of my papers on YouTube. 
- [**Oct '22**] I will be giving a talk on Distributed Data-driven Control at the 40th SoCal Control Workshop at CalTech.
- [**July '22**] Two papers on control design from data are accepted for publication at CDC '22. See you in Cancun, Mexico!
- [**May '22**] Our latest L-CSS [submission](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03656.pdf) on Geometric + Data-driven Controls has been accepted for publication.
- [**Dec '21**] Our [work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9683707) on distributed optimal data-driven controls appeared in the proceedings of the 60th CDC. Thank you Prof. [Giacomo Baggio](https://baggiogi.github.io) for the significant contribution to this work. 
- [**Nov '21**] It was fun to work with [Jaimie Swartz](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jaimie.swartz/index.html) at UC Berkley on conditions for oscillations in the power grid. Read about it on our [submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04815) to the 2022 ECC.
- [**Oct '21**] The new L-CSS issue is out, together with our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9257486) on Linear Threshold Networks and their application to the study of epilepsy in the human brain. My thanks to [Ahmed Allihboy](https://ahmedallibhoy.github.io) and [Jorge Cortés](http://carmenere.ucsd.edu/jorge/index.html) at UC San Diego.
