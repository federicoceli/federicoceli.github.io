I am an Italian student, just graduated Master of Science in Robotics and Automation Engineering at the University of Pisa, Italy; my Bachelor Degree is in Computer Engineering. I have a two years experience in the space science and research field, having collaborated as a student with the European Space Agency. From December 2017 to June 2018 I was Visiting Scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Dr. Magnus Egerstedt](https://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/) and [Prof.ssa Lucia Pallottino](http://www.centropiaggio.unipi.it/~pallottino), working on barrier certificates for safety of swarms of mixed human/autonomous networks of vehicles.
